###Challenge

Create a word cloud that displays the topics in the `topics.json` file in this Gist. An example wireframe is attached to this Gist.

- The label.property of each topic should be the 'word' in the word cloud
- Each topic should have one of 6 different text sizes, with the most popular topics largest, and least popular smallest
- A topic with a sentiment score > 60 should be displayed in green
- A topic with a sentiment score < 40 should be displayed in red
- Other topics should be displayed in grey
- When a topic is clicked, metadata about the topic should be displayed (total volume, and how that breaks down into positive, neutral and negative sentiment)

- Your implementation should be provided as a public GitHub repository, with instructions on how to run the code locally.
- Your implementation should be of a quality that you consider production-ready.
- Please use any libraries or frameworks that you consider suitable for the task

We will be looking at:

- The structure of the code and any markup
- The modularity of the code and any markup
- The suitability of the chosen technologies
- Tests
- Documentation
